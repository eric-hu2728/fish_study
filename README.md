This project was originally a joint noob scripting endeavor with my engineer buddy, fencing teammate, and fellow Goldenview Middle School alumnus Jake.
I was working with zebrafish larvae in Taiwan for my master's thesis, and Jake was kind enough to lend his Ruby expertise and brainpower to work through the main calculations.
Eventually, this work was ported over to python to create the XY Shoal Analysis project, leaving fish_study to take on a life of its own.
Stay tuned as we update fish_study with new functionalities intended for what will probably be an unrelated application.
